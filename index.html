            In today's workforce, possessing foundational digital skills is crucial. Returning citizens, who are reintegrating into society after incarceration, face significant challenges in finding employment due to the lack of access to technology during their time in prison.
            Our project focuses on bridging the digital divide and providing returning citizens with the opportunity to acquire essential digital skills. By breaking down barriers, our project aims to empower each one to thrive in the digital age.

            Each year, over 600,000 Americans are released from state and federal prisons, but they face higher unemployment rates compared to the national average (ASPE). Digital skills have become increasingly necessary in today's job market, but formerly incarcerated citizens face significant employment challenges due to their limited digital literacy resulting from resource constraints. 
When formerly incarcerated students begin their college journey, some of them encounter challenges such as include struggling with technical terminologies, staying accountable for their academic responsibilities, comprehending and completing assignments, as well as feeling hesitant to seek assistance. These challenges arise from the need to develop familiarity with technology tasks and improve their basic computer skills. Additionally, some of these students are more vulnerable to online scams and phishing attacks. Moreover, the lack of sufficient support and guidance worsens these difficulties, leading to low retention rates and difficulties in finding employment. These challenges impede their successful integration into society and hinder their ability to overcome obstacles.

            Our primary goal is to empower returning citizens by providing them with the essential digital skills they need to succeed. To achieve this, our web app focuses on key features, including a language filter for technical terms, a personalized learning path, and topic walkthroughs.
The language filter feature enables students with technical terms by providing an alphabetical list and a search function. Visual representations and explanations accompany each term to aid comprehension. Second, the personalized learning path helps students assess their comfort level with technical jargon through an assessment exam. Based on the results, it offers personalized recommendations and courses to support their learning journey. Additionally, the website includes topic walkthroughs, providing step-by-step guidance on specific topics to assist students in their understanding of technology further.
These features prioritize improving Project Rebound students' understanding of technology and enhancing their experience in navigating academic requirements.

            <h3> Research Methods</h3>
          </header>
           <p style="text-align: left;">
          We used interviews to gauge a better understanding of how we could support students in asking for help regarding technological issues. The primary goal of this study is to investigate Project Rebound students’ use of technology and identify potential areas for improvement. Interviewing the Project Rebound staff gave us a perspective on their viewpoints on helping students from the program. We decided to interview the staff because they already have experience working with the students and have an understanding of what they are struggling with and which areas they need support in. 
        </p> 
        <header>
          <h3>  Details of Participation</h3>
        </header>
          
          <p style="text-align: left;">
          We interviewed a total of three Project Rebound staff via online Zoom. We recorded the interviews, and from the transcripts, we dissected the recorded data. By using the method of code tracking, we summarized different sections from the interview, then created inferred codes that would be used for our data analysis.

          <h3>   Analysis</h3>
        </header>
          
          <p style="text-align: left;">

         
          3-4 people were involved in the data analysis process. After the interviews, we used the transcripts to summarize important information. Then, from the summaries, we inferred codes that would be used for our affinity diagram. After combining all the codes, we gathered enough data to group common findings. After separating them into groups, we grouped them again to connect themes to call out relationships like dependencies and sequences.

          </ul>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Current Challenges</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Current Issues:</strong></p>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Students face a lot of challenges when they re-enter back into society and are unaware of how advanced technology has become.</li>
            <li>Students have limited skills dealing with basic tasks like remembering passwords or difficulty transitioning from pen and paper to digital or using simple basics of a computer like a mouse or scrolling.</li>
            <li>Some issues have a time limit, and sometimes students are scared of asking, leading to the issue escalating to the point of no return, and it becomes too late.</li>
            <li>Students need more help when they’re free, which is usually during the evening.</li>
            <li>Students are prey to phishing scams.</li>
            <li>Lack of access to technology such as laptops or the internet.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Challenges that Project Rebound Offices Face:</strong></p>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>It was a long process of establishing resources and support for students.</li>
            <li>Because students need more help when they’re free in the evening, the timing might be inconvenient since that’s when Project Rebound staff are no longer in the office.</li>
            <li>Direct correlation with the number of prisons, the number of people coming in and out of incarceration, and the need for more resources and support for students.</li>
            <li>Lack of understanding from those not in the scope of Project Rebound.</li>
            <li>Students are frustrated when it takes a long time to learn a skill, and because of that, Project Rebound staff try to advise students that with time and practice, learning will become easier.</li>
            <li>Supporting students requires massive amounts of time and effort, even for basic tasks like remembering passwords.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Academia Challenges:</strong></p>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Students are unfamiliar with advanced technological tasks for school like paying tuition or picking classes.</li>
            <li>Some students from Project Rebound are used to writing non-traditionally or information which may lead to issues transitioning to college-level writing and formatting.</li>
            <li>Some students are not familiar with academic requirements and need guidance.</li>
            <li>Students lack understanding of the terminology associated with technology regarding the school, like “go to student center” or “download duo mobile.”</li>
          </ul>
          
          
          
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Addressing challenges and ways, we help students:
          </strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Addressing the challenges with technology:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>Project Rebound Staff takes the time to work with the students who are struggling.</li>
  <li>A need to help students understand technological terms.</li>
  <li>A need to teach students ways of managing and keeping safe of their passwords.</li>
  <li>A need to build trust with students and how because of the lack of trust, they are less likely to seek help.</li>
  <li>There should be a basic language that could be shared among everyone, like how people could stick with saying “press enter” not “press return” or the other way around.</li>
  <li>It is important to allow students to learn by themselves and only give guidance when they are stuck so that they may remember next time.</li>
  <li>A need to educate students on how to notice a phishing scam.</li>
  <li>We need to help encourage students so that they will become less intimidated by technology.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. How to help students:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>Developing a platform in which we can provide resources that can help students learn tech skills as needed.</li>
  <li>Being patient when helping students, as some may have a steeper learning curve.</li>
  <li>Helping students adapt to the culture of college and normalizing asking for help.</li>
  <li>The best and most effective way of helping students is in-person step-by-step guidance.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How Project Rebound Staffs Help Students:

</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Project Rebound’s Philosophy:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>J believes that it is of utmost necessity to help students understand terminology regarding technology to bridge the gap.</li>
  <li>High Touch support is necessary for students.</li>
  <li>We must not assume that everyone has technology skills or what level they are at.</li>
  <li>Everybody started at the same place, someone had to teach another person technology.</li>
  <li>Technology is developing fast, and so there’s a need to adapt.</li>
  <li>J believes that technology is commonly used in the “free, free world” and so the students NEED to adjust and learn to succeed.</li>
  <li>The program covers the tuition and books so that the students don’t have to worry about the financial aspect of college.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fear of Asking:
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Students and their fears:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>Students are often uncomfortable with asking.</li>
  <li>They fear judgment and feel embarrassed about asking certain questions in class.</li>
  <li>Some are shy and try not to depend on others in fear of burdening them, so they hesitate to ask.</li>
  <li>Some are ashamed of asking a younger person something that they seem to do like second nature. They are also afraid of asking since there’s a lot of shame with some choices they have made in the past, and they’re not the same person anymore.</li>
  <li>Because of the fear of asking for help, students will either:
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-left: 1.2em;">
      <li>Attempt to use their laptop on their own.</li>
      <li>Not use their laptop at all and ignore their tasks/duties at hand.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When attempting by themselves, they will ask when they become confused, which at that point, they might have dug a bigger hole and the problem will take longer to fix.</li>
  <li>Some take notes down and then ask questions later when there are fewer people around.</li>
  <li>Sometimes students want a bit more privacy because their questions may contain private details. A bit more privacy leads to less shame as they don’t have to worry about other people thinking negatively of them asking simple questions.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Students are Capable of Learning and Asking for Help:

</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Project Rebound students are capable:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0;text-align: left;">
  <li>PR students face challenges with technology not because they lack the ability to use it, but because they are not familiar with the terminology associated with it. They are very capable of learning technology.</li>
  <li>Students are capable of asking and speaking out when they require assistance.</li>
  <li>There are plenty of resources that students can also use other than Project Rebound, like Google or YouTube, which have many accessible and helpful resources that may help the students find solutions.</li>
  <li>DPRC is also available at some campuses, and they have expertise to provide support to students with different needs, such as if some students have visual impairment.</li>
</ul>

            <h2>Implications for Potential Design</h2>
          </header>
           <p style="text-align: left;">Based on our findings, we decided on two design ideation examples that would help contribute to they application: Language Filter Feature for Technical Terms and Personal Learning Path
          </p>
          <header>
            <h3>1. Language Filter Feature for Technical Term
            </h3>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How:</strong> One design idea to address the challenge of technical jargon is to incorporate a language filter feature that can filter out technical terms with visuals. For example, if students are confused with "authentication," they can find a word under the "A" letter, or they can type in the word in the search box. The language feature can show a visual representation to provide further context.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Limitation:</strong> This may not be accurate—also, limitations in the explanations used. Different people can have different interpretations.</p>
          
          <header>
            <h3>2. Personal Learning Path</h3>
          </header>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How:</strong> Different students have different levels of tech comfort. Here's how the personal learning path can be implemented:
            <ol style="text-align: left;">
              <li>When students access the website, they can take a proficiency level assessment to see their comfort level with technical jargon. It can be an interactive exercise that gauges their tech knowledge level.</li>
              <li>Based on the test results, the system can generate a personalized learning path for different students. This could include a series of learning resources such as tutorials, videos (phishing awareness, logging in Gmail, using YouTube), and interactive games. For example, let's consider John, a beginner. The learning system can provide basic explanations. As his comfort level progresses, he can access more advanced resources.</li>
              <li>The system needs feedback from students. As John progresses through the learning path, he can share his needs and provide feedback for improvements.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Limitation:</strong> There are a few limitations to consider:
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
              <li>First, comprehensiveness is important for personalized learning tools. If the content is outdated or incomplete, students may have knowledge gaps.</li>
              <li>Second, as a self-learning tool, students may need additional motivation to stay engaged and actively participate in the learning process.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            Our initial design for the website was kept simple and focused on user experience. Here are the main features:
          </p>
           <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Landing Page:</strong> The landing page includes a hero image section that captures users' attention. The main features of the website are highlighted below the hero image, providing a clear overview of what the website offers.</p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Language Filter for Technical Terms:</strong> Users can access the language filter feature to explore and understand technical terms. Upon selecting this option, they are directed to a dedicated page where technical terms are listed alphabetically. Each term is accompanied by explanations and, in some cases, short video explanations and images for better understanding.</p>

 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Personal Learning Path:</strong> Users can select the personal learning path option. For new users, they are directed to an assessment page to evaluate their comfort level with technical terminology. The assessment consists of 10 questions designed to gauge their proficiency. Once completed, the system generates a personalized course based on their comfort level, providing recommendations and resources to support their learning journey.</p>

 <p style="text-align: left;">Overall, our design focuses on simplicity, user-friendly navigation, and personalized learning experiences to enhance the overall learning journey of Project Rebound students.</p>

          </header>

           <p style="text-align: left;">
            After completing our quick and dirty wireframe, we engaged in a discussion to evaluate each component. Overall, the direction was on the right track, but some minor changes were identified. These changes primarily involved refining the layout and emphasizing support for individuals who may struggle to articulate their ideas.

          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"> 
            To address this, we decided to incorporate a help center page. The help center will serve as a resource hub, providing guidance and assistance to users who may need additional support. It will offer various resources, FAQs, submit your questions, and a chat feature for direct communication with support staff. By including a help center, we aim to create a supportive environment and ensure that all users can access the necessary assistance to enhance their learning experience.
          </p>
          <h3>Prototype Iterations</h3>
           <p style="text-align: left;">
            After finalizing the wireframe, we proceeded to develop high-fidelity versions of the project, incorporating UI designs that align with our chosen brand colors, typeface choices, and other design elements. Based on the design system, we aimed to create a cohesive and visually appealing user interface.

           <p style="text-align: left;">During the usability testing phase, we conducted internal tests using Nielsen Norman Group's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design as guidelines. These heuristics provided a framework for evaluating the usability and user experience of our design.
          </p>
           <p style="text-align: left;">The problems we identified and what we changed based on the problem:</p>

          <h3>2. Usability Testing: Iteration Round Two</h3>

           <p style="text-align: left;">
            
            In the usability testing phase, we conducted two Zoom meetings with the director of Project Rebound and one student from SFSU. These meetings allowed us to observe the participants as they interacted with the prototype of the web platform. During the meetings, we observed the participants as they interacted with the prototype and asked them to complete tasks to assess their user error rates and the system usability scale. The purpose of this study was to identify specific elements of the web platform that users find challenging or difficult to use and understand the reasons behind any confusion they may experience. The testing was conducted after the second hi-fi prototype was completed.
            
          </p>
           <p style="text-align: left;">During the usability testing sessions, participants had a positive impression of the prototypes overall. They particularly liked the two main features of the web platform. However, some areas were identified for improvement based on their feedback:

<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>Adding common words on the "Search for Technical Words" page: Users felt that including commonly used technical terms would enhance the usefulness of the feature.</li>
  <li>Rewording the copy written on the homepage: Users recommended rephrasing the headline to make it more clear. Making sure that it clearly conveys the purpose and advantages of the web platform.</li>
  <li>During the observation, users encountered difficulty navigating to the two main features. To address this, there was an adding a dropdown menu on the navigation bar, making it more accessible.</li>
  <li>Improve the navigation of tests by incorporating progress indicators and question navigation buttons. This allows users to track their progress and easily move between questions, enhancing the overall user experience.</li>
</ul>

            <h2>Future Design Potential</h2>
          </header>

           <p style="text-align: left;">
            Designers like us should try and reach out to our target users and try to get feedback straight from them. Project Rebound and other projects similar to ours require constant feedback from its users due to the fact that there will always be changes that need to be updated. The design should always be simple and straightforward and combined with feedback, we will be able to minimize any confusion. We also need to be hasty in terms of updating the website as users are using the site around the clock and they may need the site at a moment’s notice. In terms of potential, we could still implement more pages that could incorporate our users' input. For example we can allow users to make their own walkthroughs and have a Project Rebound administrator check whether it’s a good idea to include it or not. 
          </p>
           <p style="text-align: left;">
            We need to stray away from making design elements confusing for users and making sure that Project Rebound staff as well as the website material is up to date. Because of the fact that we provide help and tutorials to other websites, whenever there is a change on those websites such as a UI change or naming schema change, it needs to be updated on our end as well. It wouldn’t make sense for our tutorials to have outdated information or staff members helping users while they’re not seeing the same things on each end.

          </header>
         

           <p style="text-align: left;">
            
            In this section, the culmination of the design process is presented, showcasing the final design solution that incorporates feedback and iterations from the usability testing phase. The primary objective is to showcase a refined and improved design that addresses users’ needs and aligns with the project goals. The final design encompasses several key features that enhance the user experience.

          </p>
        

           <p style="text-align: left;">Our initial website design prioritized simplicity and a positive user experience. Here are the main features that were incorporated:</p>
          
           <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Language Filter for Technical Terms:</strong></p>
          
           <p style="text-align: left;">It serves as a valuable tool to assist users in understanding technical jargon. This feature provides users with easy access to a page that lists technical terms alphabetically. To further enhance comprehension, we have included explanations for each term. In addition, we have incorporated short video explanations and images to provide visual aids that aid in better understanding. The integration of text, videos, and images helps users understand the meaning and context of technical terms more effectively. Furthermore, we have taken into consideration users' feedback and included common words alongside technical terms to provide additional clarity and improve the overall user experience.</p>
          
           <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Personal Learning Path:</strong></p>
          
           <p style="text-align: left;">It features a Personal Learning Path that caters to the individual needs and proficiency levels of users. New users are directed to an assessment page where they can evaluate their comfort level with technical terminology. The assessment comprises 10 questions designed to gauge their proficiency. One improvement we made to the design is allowing users to go back and change their answers, ensuring they can provide accurate responses. Based on the assessment results, the system generates a personalized course specifically tailored to each user's proficiency level. This personalized course includes recommendations and resources that align with their learning needs, enabling them to progress at their own pace and focus on areas that require improvement. By providing this approach, we aim to enhance the learning journey of users, promoting a more effective and engaging educational experience.</p>
          
           <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Topic WalkThrough:</strong></p>
          
           <p style="text-align: left;">We also offer walkthroughs and provide step-by-step guidance on specific topics to assist students in their understanding of technology further.</p>
          
           <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Help Center:</strong></p>
          
           <p style="text-align: left;">To provide further support and assistance to students, we have included a Help Center within the website. The Help Center serves as a place where students can find answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs), upload questions, and talk with online staff members. This feature is designed to address any questions or difficulties students may encounter while using the platform, ensuring they have the necessary support and guidance to navigate their learning journey effectively.</p>
